# bkper-slack-update
Update a **Slack** channel with account balance values from **Bkper** with **Google Apps Script**. 

This script updates a **finances** channel on Slack with the number of "Converted" users and over how many "Countries" these are spread.

**Converted** & **Countries** are [Accounts](https://help.bkper.com/en/articles/2569150-accounts) on Bkper. You can choose any metric (account) that is relevant to your Slack channel.

Each time one of the balance values reaches a new record high a :first_place_medal: is presented and with both account balance values on a new record hight, a :trophy: is presented. 

A simply daily nodge, actioned by a trigger, that keeps teams on Slack updated on growth.
